          I'm a budding software engineer who gets excited solving real-world
          problems and working on innovative projects. During my past industry
          experience, I've collaborated with multiple teams on exciting projects
          - Samsung Ads. I believe in continuous learning and parallely work on
          my technical and non-technical skills.<span id="expand"></span>

            In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, put my camera
            skills to action. I, occasionally, play outdoor games like
            basketball, football, and squash. Apart from these, I consider
            myself a theatre enthusiast and was also involved in multiple
            theatrical plays during my undergraduate studies.
