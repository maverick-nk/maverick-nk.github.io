        I'm a goal-driven Software Engineer with a diverse background, who is currently expanding my knowledge in
        Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My background revolves around collaborating on large-scale
        distributed systems. I was engaged with Samsung's advertising platform, concentrating predominantly on its
        backend and infrastructure. Moreover, I possess a keen curiosity about machine learning and have engaged in
        independent projects encompassing tasks such as digit detection, recommendation systems, and language
        identification in the past.

          In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, put my camera
          skills to action. I prefer playing outdoor games like
          basketball, football, and squash. Apart from these, I consider
          myself a theatre enthusiast and was also involved in multiple
          theatrical plays during my undergraduate studies.
